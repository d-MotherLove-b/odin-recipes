    <h2>Easy Weeknight Spaghetti with Meat Sauce</h2>
    <p>For this spaghetti, we turn to our favorite quick meat sauce recipe. It’s made using one-pot, is ultra flavorful, and can be made in under 45 minutes. The spaghetti sauce is also perfect for making ahead. It can be refrigerated for up to three days and stored in your freezer for about three months. </p>
    <p> Check the package directions of the spaghetti you plan to cook. On the box, there should be an approximate cook time for “al-dente,” which means the pasta will be tender, but not mushy. It will still have a bit of a bite, which is perfect.
        <br>
        When you know the suggested cook time, set a timer for a minute or so before it. So if the box suggests 10 minutes, set a timer for 8 minutes.
        <br>
        This way, at the 8-minute mark, you can check on the spaghetti to make sure it isn’t done already. The box directions are a helpful guide, but it’s always a good idea to check the pasta early!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>SPAGHETTI AND MEAT SAUCE</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
    <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
    <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    <br>

    <h4>OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS, SEE NOTES</h4>
    <li>2 to 3 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
    <li>3 to 4 anchovy fillets, minced with some of their oil or use anchovy paste
    Pinch sugar</li>
    <li>1 leftover rind from a wedge of parmesan</li>
    </ul>

        
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <h3>Make Sauce</h3>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>

                    <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>

                    <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>            
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <h3>Cook Spaghetti</h3>
                <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <h3>To Finish</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
                </ol>
            </ol>
