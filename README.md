The Odin Project -  Project: Recipes

This exercise will help to reinforce some of if not all of the principals of 
HTML that I have learned to this point using The ODIN Project as my guide. 

I look forward to completing this challenge and I anticipate I am up to the
challenge give my previous familiarity with HTML from past lives.

I found the assignment fairly straight forward and easy as expected 
My biggest challenge as learning the most efficient use of VS Code to input
content copied from other sources off the internet. 

So far I am enjoying learning new platforms I am not used too and have 
limited exposure too such as git, github and xubuntu which I am running from
virutal box
